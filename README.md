### Disclaimer 
The code in [CompPhysics/examples](https://github.com/theofil/CompPhysics/tree/master/examples) is provided for demonstration purposes and is written having in mind three principles:

   * reflect the math forms taught symbolically *as-they-appear* in the lecture
   * code length should be minimal and take least effort to comprehend
   * assume little, or zero programming skills 
   
That is to say, the code is not always optimized having in mind efficiency of execution. 
Fine tuning of the execution flow, while important for speed and precision, often obscures transparency at first site.
Instead, it is purposefully attempted to just demonstrate the core ideas of the underline algorithms, leaving 
higher order optimization (which could be problem-specific) to be discussed in class or in homework assigments.

*The usage of the present computational environment is optional* and is only meant to serve those that find it useful. 
The students are strongly encouraged to create their own favorite environment in their personal computer, once they feel ready to do so. You can also browse code <a href="https://github.com/theofil/CompPhysics/tree/master/studentsCode">examples from other students</a>. (Credit directly the students for things that you will like or bug reports.)
